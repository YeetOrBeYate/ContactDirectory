            <p>This project is just a basic attempt at making a full CRUD application with MongoDB. For security purposes I had to hange the password used in MongoDB Atlas, and reconfigure my backend because the password was written in plain text deep in my commits. At the time, I knew I'd need to change it, and I'm glad I did.</p>
